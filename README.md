For this project, you'll build a simple CMS for a blog, based on the website Medium. For the first version of this app, you'll only be storing `posts`, which contain `title`,  `image_url`,  and `contents` columns.

Users should be able to:

1. See a detail page for a single post
2. Create new posts using a form
3. Destroy existing posts
4. Update existing posts using a form
5. See a list of all posts

Use the mockups of the [index](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tsl-s15/message/blob/master/public/index.html) and [show](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tsl-s15/message/blob/master/public/show.html) pages in the public folder as a starting point. Move all the CSS between the `style` tags into the **application.css** file in /app/assets/stylesheets. Make sure you paste the CSS below all the commented out text without deleting any text that's already in the file.
